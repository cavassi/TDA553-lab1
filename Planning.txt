Implementation inheritance (subclassing)

- Good?
We use superclass instead of interface, this is because the different car models are based on the same object ("is a car"). We want
the objects to be indirectly but strongly connected to one eachother. We are not using a interface because we want to use variables
and not only methods from the "base-class".  
- Bad?
